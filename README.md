Tasker is a simple program for TODO lists. It lets user have a list with per-directory scope. Every list is saved as tasks.json in an array of strings.
## GETTING TASKER
There is currently only one way of getting tasker. Good thing it's cross-platform.
- get golang [go.dev](https://go.dev/dl) 
- install tasker: `go install https://github.com/marekor555/tasker@latest`
- run app: `tasker`
- if you get an error saying that tasker wasn't found, you need to add go to the PATH, [windows](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/), [linux](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-add-directory-to-path-in-linux/), [mac](https://osxdaily.com/2014/08/14/add-new-path-to-path-command-line/) 
> Disclaimer: macos isn't directly supported for this app, might and might not work.
